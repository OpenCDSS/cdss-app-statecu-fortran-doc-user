The daily minimum temperature file (\*.tmn) contains minimum daily temperature values in degrees Fahrenheit 
for each climate station for years **`t2nyr1`** through **`t2nyr2`**, described below. The daily minimum temperature file 
is used for the Penman-Monteith, Modified Hargreaves, and ASCE Standardized Penman-Monteith daily ET methods 
(**`flag1`**`= 3, 4, or 5`, respectively in the model control file, [Section 4.4](../InputDescription/44.md)). The data must be in calendar year 
format.  The file must contain data for all years in the simulation between **`nyr1`** and **`nyr2`**, defined in the model 
control file (see [Section 4.4](../InputDescription/44.md)).  There must be a one-to-one correspondence between the climate stations listed 
in the climate station data file (\*.cli) and the climate station data in the daily minimum temperature file. An 
example is provided in [Appendix A](../AppendixA/A1.md).  Note that daily climate data can not be processed with a monthly consumptive 
use method (e.g. Modified Blaney-Criddle, Original Blaney-Criddle, or Pochop).
