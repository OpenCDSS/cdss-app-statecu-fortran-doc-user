The StateCU monthly temperature file contains average monthly temperature values in degrees Fahrenheit for 
each temperature station for years __`gnyr1`__ through __`gnyr2`__, described below. The monthly temperature file is used 
for the monthly Blaney-Criddle ET methods (__`flag1`__`= 1` in the model control file, [Section 4.4](../InputDescription/44.md)).  Missing data is 
accepted using a â€“999 place holder.  The data must be in calendar year format for the StateCU program.  The file 
must contain data (or -999) for all years in the simulation between __`nyr1`__ and __`nyr2`__, defined in the model control 
file (see [Section 4.4](../InputDescription/44.md)). There must be a one-to-one correspondence between climate stations listed in the climate 
station data file (*.cli) and climate station data included in the monthly temperature file. An example is provided 
in [Appendix A](../AppendixA/A1.md). 

 | Row-Data | Program Variable | Description |
    | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
	| Row 1 | Format (6x, i4, 11x, i4, 7x, a3) | |
	| 1-1 | gnyr1 | Beginning year of temperature data |
	| 1-2 | gnyr2 | Ending year of temperature data |
	| 1-3 | idum3 | CYR for calendar year |

	| Row 2 | Format (i4, 1x, a12, 12(f8.2)) | |
	| 2-1 | tyr | Year | 
	| 2-2 | tid | Temperature station ID |
	| 2-3 | tmpt(1,tyr,1-12) | Average temperature for months 1-12 (Degrees Fahrenheit) |
	
Repeat for the number of temperature stations. 

Repeat for each year **`gnyr1`** through **`gnyr2`**.
