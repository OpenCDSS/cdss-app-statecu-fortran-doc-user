The daily precipitation file (\*.pdy) contains daily precipitation in inches for each climate station 
for years **`pnyr1`** through **`pnyr2`**, described below. The daily precipitation file is used for the Penman-Monteith, 
Modified Hargreaves, and ASCE Standardized Penman-Monteith daily ET methods (**`flag1`**`= 3, 4, or 5`, respectively 
in the model control file, [Section 4.4](../InputDescription/44.md)).  The data must be in calendar year format.  The file must contain 
data for all years in the simulation between **`nyr1`** and **`nyr2`**, defined in the model control file (see [Section 4.4](../InputDescription/44.md)). 
There must be a one-to-one correspondence between the climate stations listed in the climate station data file 
(\*.cli) and the climate station data in the daily precipitation file. An example is provided in [Appendix A](../AppendixA/A1.md). 
Note that daily climate data can not be processed with a monthly consumptive use method (e.g. Modified 
Blaney-Criddle, Original Blaney-Criddle, or Pochop).
