The daily administration number time series file (\*.add) provides daily administration numbers that can be 
used to color daily diversions either senior or junior if water rights are considered.  If a daily diversion 
data input file is included in the analysis, the daily data can be processed according to priority (**`idaily`**`= 1`, 
see [Section 4.4](../InputDescription/44.md)).  The data must be in calendar year format for the StateCU program.  An example is provided 
in [Appendix A](../AppendixA/A1.md).
