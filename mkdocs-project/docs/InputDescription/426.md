The daily vapor pressure file (\*.vap) contains daily vapor pressure in mbars for each climate station 
for years **`vnyr1`** through **`vnyr2`**, described below. The daily vapor pressure file is used for the Penman-Monteith 
and ASCE Standardized Penman-Monteith daily ET methods (**`flag1`**`= 3 or 5` in the model control file, [Section 4.4](../InputDescription/44.md)). 
The data must be in calendar year format.  The file must contain data for all years in the simulation between 
**`nyr1`** and **`nyr2`**, defined in the model control file (see [Section 4.4](../InputDescription/44.md)).  There must be a one-to-one correspondence 
between the climate stations listed in the climate station data file (\*.cli) and the climate station data in 
the daily vapor pressure file.  An example is provided in [Appendix A](../AppendixA/A1.md).
