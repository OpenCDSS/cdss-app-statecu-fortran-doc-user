The daily historical diversion file (\*.ddy), provides historic daily diversions for a list of structures. 
Water supply contained in the daily historical diversion file (\*.ddy) represents river headgate diversions, 
not the supply delivered to the crop.  Daily diversions must sum to the monthly diversions used in the monthly 
historical diversion file (\*.ddh). When the user chooses to process daily diversions by priority (**`idaily`**`= 1`, 
see [Section 4.4](../InputDescription/44.md)), the StateCU uses the daily diversion file to determine the percent of monthly diversions 
(in the \*.ddh file, see [Section 4.13](../InputDescription/413.md)) that are senior or junior to the user input administration number(s). 
Missing data is accepted using a â€“999 placeholder.  The file can contain more structures than defined by the 
structure location file (\*.str), but must include all structures being simulated.  Likewise, the total years 
can be more than the study defined in the model control file by **`nyr1`** and **`nyr2`** (see [Section 4.4](../InputDescription/44.md)).

Repeat for the number of structures.

Repeat for each year of the simulation.
