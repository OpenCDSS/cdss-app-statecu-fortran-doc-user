StateCU allows two types of crop consumptive use analysis: (1) Climate Station Scenario – based on a unit 
acreage at a climate station location, or (2) Structure Scenario – based on a specified acreage at a structure 
location.  The __`iclim`__ flag in the StateCU model control file (\*.ccu) specifies whether the analysis is a Climate 
Station Scenario (__`iclim`__`= 0`) or a Structure Scenario (__`iclim`__`= 1`). The structure file provides non-time variant 
properties for the consumptive use locations.  **A structure location file must be provided for both types of 
analysis.**  With a Climate Station Scenario, the structure ID and name will be identical to the climate station 
ID and name in the climate station (*.cli) file and the precipitation and temperature weights will be set to 1.0 
unless the structure is representing a field location or weighted climate station.  In that case, up to five 
different climate stations and corresponding temperature and precipitation weights can be specified (see [Section 
3.1.7](../ModelDescription/31.md)).  In addition, an orographic adjustment can be specified for selected climate stations, as described in 
[Section 3.1.7](../ModelDescription/31.md).  The structure information file is required for all crop consumptive use model runs.  An example 
file is provided in [Appendix A](../AppendixA/A1.md).
