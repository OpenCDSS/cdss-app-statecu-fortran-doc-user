The Climate Station Information File provides climate station location information.  The climate station information 
file is required for all crop consumptive use model runs.  When a monthly consumptive use analysis is chosen (__`flag1`__`= 1` 
in the Model Control File, see [Section 4.4](../InputDescription/44.md)), there must be a one-to-one correspondence between climate stations 
listed in the climate station data file (\*.cli) and climate station data included in the monthly temperature file 
(\*.tem), the monthly precipitation file (\*.prc), and the frost date file (\*.fd).  When a daily consumptive use 
analysis is chosen (__`flag1`__`= 3, 4, or 5` in the Model Control File, see [Section 4.4](../InputDescription/44.md)), there must be a one-to-one 
correspondence between the climate stations listed in the climate station data file (\*.cli) and the climate station 
data included in the frost date (\*.fd), daily maximum temperature (\*.tmx), daily minimum temperature (\*.tmn), daily 
precipitation (\*.pdy), daily solar radiation (\*.sol), daily vapor pressure (\*.vap), and daily wind speed (\*.wnd) 
files. Instrument heights for temperature and wind measurements are only used in a daily consumptive use analysis. 
If height information is missing from the \*.cli file, StateCU will use 4.92 feet (1.5 meters) and 6.56 feet (2.0 
meters), which represent the standard instrument height for Colorado Agricultural Meteorological Network (CoAgMet) 
stations.  An example file is provided in Appendix A.
