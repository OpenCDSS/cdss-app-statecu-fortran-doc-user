The crop coefficient file (\*.kmh) contains Modified Hargreaves crop coefficient curves developed by Agro 
Engineering, Inc.  This file is read when **`flag1`**`= 4` in the model control file (see [Section 4.4](../InputDescription/44.md)). 
The recommended naming convention to identify crops with their crop coefficients is `Crop_Name.XXX` as 
described in [Section 3.1.7](../ModelDescription/31.md).  An example is provided in [Appendix A](../AppendixA/A1.md).

 | Row-Data | Program Variable | Description |
    | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
	| Row 1 | Format (a80) | |
	| 1-1 | remark | Title |
	| | | |
	| Row 2-4 | Free Format | |
	| 2-1 | nc | Number of crop coefficient curves |
	| 3-1 | id | Crop number (not used in StateCU) |
	| 3-2 | cropn | Crop name |
	| 4-1 | kcday(1) | Number of days to 10 percent cover |
	| 5-1 | kcday(2) | Number of days to 80 percent cover |
	| 6-1 | kcday(3) | Number of days to crop maturity |
	| 7-1 | kcday(4) | Number of days to crop harvest |
	| 8-1 | kcb(1) | Crop coefficient K1 |
	| 9-1 | kcb(2) | Crop coefficient K2 | 
	| 10-1 | kcb(3) | Crop coefficient K3 |
	
Repeat for the number of crop coefficient curves, **`nc`**.

Note that additional information is required for alfalfa.  
If the crop is alfalfa (**`cropn`**`= ALFALFA.MHG`), then the following format applies for rows 3 through 12:

 | Row-Data | Program Variable | Description |
    | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
	| Row 3-12 | Free Format | |
	| 3-1 | id | Crop number (not used in StateCU) |
	| 3-2 | cropn | 'ALFALFA.MHG' |
	| 4-1 | kcday(1) | Number of days to 10 percent cover |
	| 5-1 | kcday(2) | Number of days to 80 percent cover |
	| 6-1 | kcday(3) | Number of days to first cut |
	| 7-1 | kcday(4) | Number of days to crop maturity |
	| 8-1 | kcday(5) | Number of days to second cut |
	| 9-1 | kcday(6) | Number of days to crop harvest |
	| 10-1 | kcb(1) | Crop coefficient K1 |
	| 11-1 | kcb(2) | Crop coefficient K2 | 
	| 12-1 | kcb(3) | Crop coefficient K3 |
