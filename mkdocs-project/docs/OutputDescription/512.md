The StateMod formatted ground water pumping file (\*.gwp) is generated when the variable **`ddcsw`**`=  1`
and **`isuply`**`= 4` in the model control file (see [Section 4.4](../InputDescription/44.md)). This output file contains the 
estimated monthly ground water pumping for each structure. It is written in the standard StateMod format 
in calendar year format for time series information.
