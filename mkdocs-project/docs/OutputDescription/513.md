The StateMod formatted average direct diversion efficiency file (\*.def) is generated when the variable 
**`ddcsw`**`= 1` and **`isuply`**`= 1` or greater in the StateCU control file (see [Section 4.4](../InputDescription/44.md)). The 
direct diversion efficiency file contains average monthly system efficiency (conveyance *application) 
for each structure.  The StateMod formatted average well efficiency file (\*.wef) is generated when the 
variable **`ddcsw`**`= 1` and **`isuply`**`= 4` in the StateCU control file (see [Section 4.4](../InputDescription/44.md)).  The well 
efficiency file contains average ground water application efficiency for each structure. Both average 
efficiency files are output in calendar year.  The average monthly efficiency files are used in StateDMI 
along with irrigation water requirements to create the StateMod ‘calculated’ direct diversion demand file 
(\*.ddm). Note that if monthly efficiencies can not be determined because either the irrigation water requirement 
or diversion data is missing, then the maximum monthly efficiency is reported in the well and diversion efficiency 
files.  An example average surface monthly water efficiency is provided in [Appendix A](../AppendixA/A1.md).
