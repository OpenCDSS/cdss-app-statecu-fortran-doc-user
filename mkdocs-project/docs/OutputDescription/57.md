The detailed structure water budget by land category file (\*.4wb) is generated with the output file option 
**`typout`**`= 4, 5, 14 or 15` in the model control file (see [Section 4.4](../InputDescription/44.md)). As discussed in [Section 4.15](../InputDescription/415.md), acreage for each ditch is input by four land categories; sprinkler irrigated with surface water-only, 
flood irrigated with surface water only, sprinkler irrigated supplemented with ground water, and flood irrigated 
supplemented with ground water.  If the structure represents ground water use only, the surface water category 
acreage would be zero. This option provides the detailed information outlined in the Farm Water Budget Output 
File (\*.dwb) broken out by land category for specified structures (**`typout`**`= 4 or 14`) or all structures 
(**`typout`**`= 5 or 15`) as defined in the model control file. An example is provided in [Appendix A](../AppendixA/A1.md).  Also see 
[Appendix A](../AppendixA/A1.md) for a list of the parameters available in this output file, and information on the model control 
options that are set to create each output parameter.
