The water supply limited consumptive use (\*.wsl) file is calculated for the water supply limited 
crop consumptive use and depletion analyses (**`isuply`**`> 0` is the model control file, see [Section 4.4](../InputDescription/44.md)). 
The supply limited consumptive use output file (\*.wsl) is generated when the output file option 
**`typout`** is set to level 1 or greater in the model control file. The following information is 
provided by structure for each year in the simulation period: 

* annual structure acreage used in analysis, 
* monthly supply limited consumptive use in acre-feet, 
* annual supply limited consumptive use in acre-feet, and 
* annual supply limited application rate in acre-feet per acre.

In addition, average monthly and yearly values are also provided by structure over the simulation 
period.  A simulation summary is also included with the above information, by year, for all simulation 
structures combined.  An example is provided in [Appendix A](../AppendixA/A1.md).
