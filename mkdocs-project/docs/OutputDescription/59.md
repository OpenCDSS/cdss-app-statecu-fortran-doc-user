The detailed Penman-Monteith output file (\*.opm) is generated when a Penman-Monteith or ASCE 
Standardized Penman-Monteith analyses is selected by setting **`flag1`**`= 3 or 5`, respectively, in 
the model control file (see [Section 4.4](../InputDescription/44.md)).  This option provides detailed results of the Penman-Monteith 
or ASCE Standardized Penman-Monteith consumptive use calculation during the growing season for all crop 
types associated with each structure by day, including the following: 

* reference evapotranspiration, 
* Penman-Monteith crop coefficients \\(K_c\\), 
* potential consumptive use, 
* effective rainfall, and 
* irrigation water requirement. 

An example is provided in [Appendix A](../AppendixA/A1.md).
