The input summary output file (\*.sum) provides a summary of the inputs provided to StateCU. 
A summary output file is always generated by the model for monthly and daily consumptive use 
and depletion analyses, regardless of other output files requested.  There are two levels of 
summary output available defined by the variable **`sout`** in the model control file (see [Section 4.4](../InputDescription/44.md)). 

The basic summary (**`sout`**`= 0`) includes the following information: 

* simulation options defined in the StateCU control file, 
* total project area by crop for each year, 
* summaries of the crop characteristic file inputs for simulation crop types,
* average monthly climate information, and percent daylight hours by climate station,  
* a matrix of climate station weights assigned to each structure, and 
* average monthly water supply values by structure. 

The detailed summary (**`sout`**`= 1`) includes the following information: 

* simulation options defined in the StateCU control file, 
* total project area by crop for each year in the simulation period, 
* summaries of the crop characteristic file inputs for crop types by structure, including structure acreage, 
* monthly climate information for each year in the simulation period by climate station, 
* average monthly percent daylight hours by climate station, 
* a matrix of climate station weights assigned to each structure, and 
* monthly water supply values each year in the simulation period by structure.
