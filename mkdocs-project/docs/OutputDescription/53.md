The crop irrigation water requirement file (\*.cir) is calculated for all crop consumptive use and 
depletion analyses.  The crop irrigation water requirement output file is generated when the output 
file option **`typout`**`= 1` or greater in the model control file (see [Section 4.4](../InputDescription/44.md)).  The following 
information is provided by structure for each year in the simulation period:

* annual structure acreage used in analysis, 
* monthly crop irrigation water requirement in acre-feet, 
* annual crop irrigation water requirement in acre-feet, and 
* annual application rate in acre-feet per acre. 

In addition, average monthly and yearly values are also provided by structure over the 
simulation period.  A simulation summary is also included with the above information, 
by year, for all simulation structures combined.  An example is provided in [Appendix A](../AppendixA/A1.md).
