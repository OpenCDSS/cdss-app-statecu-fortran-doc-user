The replacement crop requirement file is a monthly StateMod formatted file of crop irrigation water 
requirement.  When this file is included in the StateCU response file, these values are used in lieu 
of StateCU  calculated crop irrigation water requirement for all structures in the scenario.  This 
functionality allows the user to develop crop irrigation water requirements independendent of StateCU, 
but takes advantage of the StateCU water budget to calculate water supply limited consumptive use, 
estimated pumping, or any other parameter available in the detaile water budget. An example is provided 
in [Appendix A](../Appendix A/A1.md).

 | Row-Data | Program Variable | Description |
    | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
	| Row 1 | Format (6x, i4, 11x, i4, 7x, a3) | |
	| 1-1 | jyr1 | Beginning year of diversion data |
	| 1-2 | jyr2 | Ending year of diversion data |
	| 1-3 | idum3 | CYR for calendar year or WYR for water year |
	| | | |
	| Row 2 | Format (i4, 1x, a12, 12(f8.2)) | |
	| 2-1 | tyr | Year |
	| 2-2 | tid | Structure ID |
	| 2-3 | tail(1,tyr,1-12) | Replace crop requirement for months 1-12(acre-feet) |
	
Repeat for the number of structures that have a replacement crop requirement.

Repeat for each year **jyr1** through **jyr2**.
