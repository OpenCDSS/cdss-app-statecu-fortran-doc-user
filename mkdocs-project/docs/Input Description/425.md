The daily solar radiation file (\*.sol) contains daily solar radiation in langleys for each climate 
station for years **rnyr1** through **rnyr2**, described below. The daily solar radiation file is used for 
the Penman-Monteith, Modified Hargreaves, and ASCE Standardized Penman-Monteith daily ET methods 
(**flag1**=3, 4, or 5, respectively in the model control file, [Section 4.4](../Input Description/44.md)). The data must be in calendar 
year format.  The file must contain data for all years in the simulation between **nyr1** and **nyr2**, defined 
in the model control file (see [Section 4.4](../Input Description/44.md)).  There must be a one-to-one correspondence between the 
climate stations listed in the climate station data file (\*.cli) and the climate station data in the daily solar 
radiation file. An example is provided in [Appendix A](../Appendix A/A1.md).
