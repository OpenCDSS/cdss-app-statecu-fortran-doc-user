The crop distribution file (\*.cds) contains total acreage and associated crop acreage for structures. 
The file can contain more structures than defined by the structure location (\*.str) file, but must include 
all structures being simulated.  This file is read for monthly and daily ET methods. The recommended naming 
convention to identify crops with their crop coefficients is ‘Crop_Name.XXXX’ as described in [Section 3.1.7](../Model Description/CropIrr.md). 
Crop names in the \*.cds file must correspond to an identical crop name in the crop coefficient (\*.kbc or \*.kpm) 
and crop characteristic file (\*.cch). Note that because of formatting constraints, total acreage must be less 
than 10 digits. An example is provided in [Appendix A](../Appendix A/A1.md).

 | Row-Data | Program Variable | Description |
    | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
	| Row 1 | Format (6x, i4, 11x, i4, 7x, a3) | |
	| 1-1 | gnyr1 | Beginning year of crop data |
	| 1-2 | gnyr2 | Ending year of crop data |
	| 1-3 | idum3 | CYR for calendar year |
	| | | |
	| Row 2 | Format (i4, 1x, a12, 18x, f10.0, i10) | |
	| 2-1 | tyr | Year |
	| 2-2 | tid | Irrigation structure ID | 
	| 2-3 | ttacre | Total acreage served by structure in specified year |
	| 2-4 | tncrop | Number of crop types for this year and structure ID |
	| | | |
	| Row 3 | Format (5x, a30, f10.3, f10.3) | |
	| 3-1 | cropn | Crop name | 
	| 3-2 | tpct(1) | Decimal fraction of total acreage planted with specified crop (no longer used by StateCU) |
	| 3-3 | cacre(1) | Total acreage planted with specified crop |
	
Repeat for all crop types, decimal fractions must add up to 1.0.

Repeat for the number of structures – can be more  structures than defined by structure location (\*.str) file, but must include all structures of interest.

Repeat for each year of data – total years can be more than study period  defined in the model control file by **nyr1** and **nyr2** (see [Section 4.4](../Input Description/44.md)).
