The daily wind speed file (\*.wnd) contains daily wind speed in miles per day for each climate station 
for years **wnyr1** through **wnyr2**, described below. The daily wind speed file is used for the Penman-Monteith, 
Modified Hargreaves, and ASCE Standardized Penman-Monteith daily ET methods (**flag1**=3, 4, or 5, respectively 
in the model control file, [Section 4.4](../Input Description/44.md)).  The data must be in calendar year format.  The file must contain 
data for all years in the simulation between **nyr1** and **nyr2**, defined in the model control file (see [Section 4.4](../Input Description/44.md)).  There must be a one-to-one correspondence between the climate stations listed in the climate station 
data file (\*.cli) and the climate station data in the daily wind speed file.  An example is provided in [Appendix A](../Appendix A/A1.md).
