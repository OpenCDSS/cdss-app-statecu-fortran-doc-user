The irrigation parameter yearly data file (\*.ipy) contains general structure information required to run 
supply-limited consumptive use analyses, including conveyance efficiencies, maximum flood irrigation efficiencies, 
maximum sprinkler efficiencies, acreage flood irrigated only with surface water, acreage sprinkler irrigated only 
with surface water, acreage flood irrigated with surface and ground water, acreage sprinkler irrigated with surface 
and ground water, maximum monthly permitted pumping volume, ground water use mode, and total irrigated acreage. The 
conveyance efficiency accounts for losses between the river headgate and the farm headgate, including losses through 
canals, ditches and laterals. The maximum flood irrigation and sprinkler efficiencies account for application losses 
between the farm headgate or well and the crops. The ground water use mode determines how surface water and ground 
water will be used to satisfy irrigation water requirements, see [Section 3.3](../Model Description/WaterSupplyStructureGW.md).  Note that data associated with ground 
water supply in the \*.ipy file will only be considered in a structure scenario when the ground water supply option 
has been set in the model control file (isuply=4).  An example is provided in [Appendix A](../Appendix A/A1.md).
