The ground water pumping file (\*.pvh) provides estimated or measured monthly pumping for a list of 
structures.  Ground water supply contained in the pumping file represents volumes pumped at the wells, 
not the supply delivered to the crop.  StateCU uses the appropriate application efficiency read in the 
irrigation parameter yearly data (\*.ipy) file, which depends on the irrigation method defined for the 
irrigated parcels, to estimate the water available to the crop. Missing data is accepted using a â€“999 
placeholder.  The file can contain only structures that have historic ground water information.  Note 
that historical pumping data is not limited by the well capacity provided in the \*.ipy.  The total years 
can be more than the study defined in the model control file by **nyr1** and **nyr2** (see [Section 4.4](../Input Description/44.md)).  This file 
is only read if a ground water supply option is defined in the model control file (**isuply**=4), however, the 
ground water pumping file is not required. The data can be in calendar year or water year.  An example is 
provided in [Appendix A](../Appendix A/A1.md).

Repeat for the number of diversion structures.

Repeat for each year **gnyr1** through **gnyr2**.
