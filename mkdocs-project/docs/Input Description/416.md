The direct diversion rights file (\*.ddr), provides water rights corresponding to a list of structures. 
For the base datasets, it is the same file used by the Water Resources Planning Model, StateMod.  The file 
can contain more structures than defined by the structure location file (*.str), but must include all 
structures being simulated.  This file is only read if a water supply by priority option is defined in the 
model control file (**isuply**=2) (see [Section 4.4](../Input Description/44.md)).  An example is provided in [Appendix A](../Appendix A/A1.md).

 | Row-Data | Program Variable | Description |
    | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
	| Row 1 | Format (a12, a24, a12, f16.5, f8.2, i8) | |
	| 1-1 | cidvri(1) | Diversion right ID |
	| 1-2 | named(1) | Diversion right name |
	| 1-3 | cgoto | Diversion structure ID associated with this right |
	| 1-4 | irtem(1) | Administration number |
	| 1-5 | dcrdiv(1) | Decreed amount (cfs) |
	| 1-6 | idvrsw(1) | Switch 0=off, 1=on |
	
Repeat for the number of diversion rights.
