The daily maximum temperature file (\*.tmx) contains maximum daily temperature values in degrees Fahrenheit 
for each climate station for years **t1nyr1** through **t1nyr2**, described below. The daily maximum temperature file 
is used for the Penman-Monteith, Modified Hargreaves, and ASCE Standardized Penman-Monteith daily ET methods 
(**flag1**=3, 4, or 5 respectively in the model control file, [Section 4.4](../Input Description/44.md)). The data must be in calendar year format. 
The file must contain data for all years in the simulation between **nyr1** and **nyr2**, defined in the model control 
file (see [Section 4.4](../Input Description/44.md)).  There must be a one-to-one correspondence between the climate stations listed in the 
climate station data file (\*.cli) and the climate station data in the daily maximum temperature file. An example 
is provided in [Appendix A](../Appendix A/A1.md).  Note that daily climate data can not be processed with a monthly consumptive use 
method (e.g. Modified Blaney-Criddle, Original Blaney-Criddle, or Pochop).
