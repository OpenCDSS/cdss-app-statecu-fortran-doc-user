Input files for the base CDSS datasets have been created using the CDSS Data Management Interfaces
developed to extract and format data from HydroBase. New datasets can be developed 1) by revising one of
the base datasets provided with the StateCU GUI, 2) interactively through the StateCU HydroBaseWizard,
3) by running the CDSS Data Management Interfaces (see [Section 8.3](../Supporting Utilities/83.md)), or 4) by building StateCU ASCII
input files using the format provided in this section. Caution should be used when editing or creating the
ASCII input files with a text editor, as StateCU is sensitive to format, and specifically does not recognize
tabs. The StateCU GUI has full editing capabilities.
