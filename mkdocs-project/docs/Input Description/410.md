The crop characteristic file (\*.cch) contains information such as planting, harvesting, and root depth 
for the crop types used in the analysis. This file is read for monthly and daily ET methods. Note that not 
all fields are used in a monthly ET analysis, as indicated below.  Missing data is accepted using a –999 
placeholder. There must be a one-to-one correspondence between crop names in the crop characteristic file 
and Blaney-Criddle crop coefficient file (\*.kbc) if **flag1** is set to 1, or the Penman-Monteith crop coefficient 
file (\*.kpm) if **flag1** is set to 3 or 5. The recommended naming convention to identify crops with their crop 
coefficients is ‘Crop_Name.XXX’ as described in [Section 3.1.7](../Model Description/CropIrr.md).  An example is provided in [Appendix A](../Appendix A/A1.md).
