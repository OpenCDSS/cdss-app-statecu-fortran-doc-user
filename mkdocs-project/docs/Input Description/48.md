The StateCU monthly precipitation file contains total monthly precipitation values in inches for each 
precipitation station for years **gnyr1** through **gnyr2**, described below.  The monthly precipitation file 
is used for the monthly Blaney-Criddle ET methods (**flag1**=1 in the model control file, [Section 4.4](../Input Description/44.md)). 
Missing data is accepted using a â€“999 place holder. The data must be in calendar year format.  The file 
must contain data (or -999) for all years in the simulation between **nyr1** and **nyr2**, defined in the model 
control file (see [Section 4.4](../Input Description/44.md)).  There must be a one-to-one correspondence between climate stations listed 
in the climate station data file (*.cli) and the climate station data included in the monthly precipitation 
file. An example is provided in [Appendix A](../Appendix A/A1.md).
