The StateCU frost date file contains the last days in the spring when the average monthly temperature values 
are below 28 degrees and 32 degrees Fahrenheit, and the first days in the fall when the average monthly temperature 
values are below 28 degrees and 32 degrees Fahrenheit.  The frost date data file is required for monthly and daily 
ET methods.  Frost date data is provided for each climate station for years **t1** through **t2**, described below. 
Missing data is accepted using a â€“999 place holder. The file must contain values (or -999) for all years in the 
simulation between **nyr1** and **nyr2**, defined in the model control file (see [Section 4.4](../Input Description/44.md)).  There must be a one-to-one 
correspondence between climate stations listed in the climate station data file (*.cli) and climate data included 
in the frost date file. An example is provided in [Appendix A](../Appendix A/A1.md).
