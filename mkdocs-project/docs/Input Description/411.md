The crop coefficient file (\*.kbc) contains Blaney-Criddle crop coefficient curves for the SCS modified 
Blaney-Criddle or original Blaney-Criddle method.  This file is read when flag1 is set to 1 in the model 
control file (see [Section 4.4](../Input Description/44.md)). There must be a one-to-one correspondence between crop names in the crop 
characteristic file (\*.cch) and Blaney-Criddle crop coefficient file. The recommended naming convention to 
identify crops with their crop coefficients is ‘Crop_Name.XXXX’ as described in [Section 3.1.7](../Model Description/CropIrr.md). An example 
is provided in [Appendix A](../Appendix A/A1.md).
