The crop coefficient file (\*.kpm) contains Penman-Monteith crop coefficient curves, as defined in ASCE-70. 
The same crop coefficient curves are used for the Penman-Monteith and the ASCE Standardized Penman-Monteith 
methods.  This file is read when **flag1** is set to 3 or 5 in the model control file (see [Section 4.4](../Input Description/44.md)).  The 
recommended naming convention to identify crops with their crop coefficients is ‘Crop_Name.XXX’ as described 
in [Section 3.1.7](../Model Description/CropIrr.md).  An example is provided in [Appendix A](../Appendix A/A1.md).

 | Row-Data | Program Variable | Description |
    | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
	| Row 1 | Format (a80) | |
	| 1-1 | remark | Title |
	| | | |
	| Row 2 | Free Format | |
	| 2-1 | nc | Number of crop coefficient curves | 
	| 3-1 | id | Crop number (not used in StateCU) |
	| 3-2 | cropn | Crop name | 
	| 4-1 | kcday(1,j) | Time from start of growth to effective cover (%) or number of days after effective cover |
	| 4-2 | kcb(1,j) | Corresponding crop coefficient for alfalfa-based ET, for crop j |

Read 33 day/crop coefficient pairs (Row 4) for alfalfa 

Read 11 day/crop coefficient pairs (Row 4) for grass pasture 

Read 22 day/crop coefficient pairs (Row 4) for all other crop types 

Repeat for the number of crop coefficient curves, nc
