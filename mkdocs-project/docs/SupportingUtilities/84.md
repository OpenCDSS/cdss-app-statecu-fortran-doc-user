The **TSTool** DMI extracts and fills climate station records from HydroBase and can create the following 
files used in StateCU:

* the monthly historical diversion (*.ddh) file (with missing data filled or flagged), 
* the daily historical diversion (*.ddy) file, 
* the  ground water pumping (*.pvh), and 
* daily and monthly historic climate data information (with missing data filled or flagged) for the following: 
	- minimum, maximum, and average temperature data, 
	- precipitation data, 
	- frost date data, 
	- wind speed data, 
	- solar radiation data, and 
	- vapor pressure data. 
	
The **TSTool** DMI can also be used to extract historic diversion records from HydroBase. For a complete
