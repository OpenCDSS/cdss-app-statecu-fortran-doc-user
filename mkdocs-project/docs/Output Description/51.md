There are several output files prepared by the StateCU model. The StateCU control file (\*.ccu) allows 
the user to choose the level of detail and combination of output files generated, as described in [Section 4.4](../Input Description/44.md). 
For simulation management, the files are given the simulation name plus a standard three-character suffix 
as described below.  Example output files are provided in [Appendix A](../Appendix A/A1.md). In addition to the output files 
generated by StateCU, requests for individual input and output parameters can be made through the StateCU 
Graphical User Interface to develop custom reports, import to Excel or a text editor, or graphically display. 
Explanatory column headings are provided in each of the output files.
