The StateMod formatted crop irrigation water requirement file (\*.ddc) is generated when the variable **ddcsw** 
is set to level 1 and **isuply** is set to 1 in the model control file (see [Section 4.4](../Input Description/44.md)).  This output file, 
like the \*.cir file, contains the estimated monthly crop irrigation water requirements for each structure. 
However, it is written in the standard StateMod format in calendar year format for time series information. 
The crop irrigation water requirement file (\*.ddc) is used by in StateDMI along with efficiency estimates to 
create the StateMod ‘calculated’ direct diversion demand file (\*.ddm). An example is provided in [Appendix A](../Appendix A/A1.md).
