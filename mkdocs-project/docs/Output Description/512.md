The StateMod formatted ground water pumping file (\*.gwp) is generated when the variable **ddcsw** is set to 
1 and **isuply** is set to 4 in the model control file (see [Section 4.4](../Input Description/44.md)). This output file contains the 
estimated monthly ground water pumping for each structure. It is written in the standard StateMod format 
in calendar year format for time series information.
