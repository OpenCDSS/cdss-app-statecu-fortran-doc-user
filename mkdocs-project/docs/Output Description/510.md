The detailed Modified Hargreaves output file (\*.omh) is generated when a Modified Hargreaves analyses is 
selected by setting **flag1** to 4 in the model control file (see [Section 4.4](../Input Description/44.md)).  This option provided detailed 
results of the Modified Hargreaves consumptive use calculation during the growing season for all crop types 
associated with each structure by day, including the following:

* reference evapotranspiration, 
* Modified Hargreaves crop coefficients \\(K_c\\), 
* potential consumptive use, 
* effective rainfall, and 
* irrigation water requirement.
