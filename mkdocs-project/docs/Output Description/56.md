The farm water budget (by structure) output file (\*.dwb) is generated when the output file option **typout** is 
set to level 3, 4, 5, 13, 14, or 15 in the model control file (see [Section 4.4](../Input Description/44.md)). As with the farm water budget 
(for simulation) output file, the farm water budget (by structure) output file contains additional information 
depending on the level of water supply limited or depletion analysis. The various output files contain the same 
information as the farm water budget (for simulation) output files except that it is provided by structure. An 
example is provided in [Appendix A](../Appendix A/A1.md).  Also see [Appendix A](../Appendix A/A1.md) for a list of the parameters available in this output 
file, and information on the model control options that are set to create each output parameter.
