The detailed Blaney-Criddle output file (\*.obc) is generated when **flag1** is set to 1 in the model control file 
(see [Section 4.4](../Input Description/44.md)). This option provides detailed results of the Blaney-Criddle consumptive use calculation 
during the growing season for all crop types associated with each structure by year including the following: 

* percent of the month considered in the calculation, 
* average temperature and daylight hours, 
* Blaney-Criddle coefficients \\(f\\) , \\(k_t\\), \\(k_c\\),  and \\(k\\) as defined in SCS TR-21, 
* potential evapotranspiration, 
* effective rainfall, and 
* irrigation water requirement. 

An example is provided in [Appendix A](../Appendix A/A1.md).
