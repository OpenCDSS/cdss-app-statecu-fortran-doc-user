The following is a list of the parameters available in the binary file, 
and information on the model control options that are set to create each output parameter.  Output from the binary 
file can be viewed through the GUI using the Time Series Data Tool, or through TSTool.  To view the binary file in 
TSTool, open the TSTool application, select ‘StateCUB’ as the input type, and navigate to the *.bd1 file through the 
standard ‘Open File’ window.  The available binary file parameters can then be accessed, modified and viewed through 
TSTool.
