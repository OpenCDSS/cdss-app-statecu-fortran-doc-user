The StateCU model is structured to perform one of four analyses described in [Section 3](../ModelDescription/31.md) as follows:

* Crop Irrigation Water Requirement by Structure or Climate Station 
* Water Supply Limited Crop Consumptive Use by Structure 
* Water Supply Limited Crop Consumptive Use by Structure and Priority 
* Depletion by Structure and Priority 

The StateCU model may be executed from a DOS command line or the StateCU GUI (see [Section 2](../GUI/21.md)). 
It is executed from a DOS command as follows: 

**`StateCU`***`file`*

where *`file`* is the response file name (containing input dataset file names) defined by the prefix for the 
StateCU response file(\.rcu).  If the response file name is omitted, the response file name will be 
requested from the screen.
