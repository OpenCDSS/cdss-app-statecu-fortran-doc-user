The __Run Simulation__ command is activated once a dataset has been loaded. When a run is initiated, the
StateCU GUI shells out to a DOS window to execute the StateCU program. The process status and any
warning or error messages are displayed in the DOS window during StateCU execution. If the execution is
successful, the DOS window will either close automatically or prompt the user to press the Enter key, and
the user will be returned to the GUI to view output ([Section 2.7](../GUI/27.md) below). If the execution is unsuccessful, the
StateCU generated log file will be displayed on the screen with a description of the error that caused the
program to terminate. The user should view the __StateCU Fortran Program Log File__ located in the
__Results__ menu or through a text editor even with a successful execution, as it may contain warnings or other
pertinent information.
