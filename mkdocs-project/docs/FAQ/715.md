A climate station scenario is used to estimate unit potential crop consumptive use and irrigation water 
requirements at a climate station location or a location represented by weighting more than one climate 
station. This analysis requires less data, therefore fewer input files, than a structure scenario. 
Required input files and associated data include:

* Scenario response file, \*.rcu – includes the names and paths of input files used for the analysis 
* Scenario control file, \*.ccu – includes analysis period, and potential consumptive use method and 
effective precipitation method used in the analysis 
* Scenario structure file, \*.str – defines the location of the analysis (climate station or field 
latitude and elevation), and defines the climate stations(s) used in the analysis 
* Climate Station file, \*.cli – provides location of climate station used in the analysis 
* Climate Station Data files 

Additional input files are required for a structure scenario, depending on the specific level of 
analysis ([Section 4](../InputDescription/41.md)).
