A ground water analysis will either consider historical ground water pumping data in the supply limited 
analysis (if available) or will estimate ground water pumping to meet irrigation water requirements 
limited by well assignments to structure acreage in the irrigation parameter file (\*.ipy).  This option 
is only available under a *Structure Scenario* and can be selected from **Menu Control Option** window if 
ground water supply data (\*.pvh) or ground water acreage information and irrigation efficiencies (\*.ipy) 
are provided. See [Section 3.3](../ModelDescription/33.md) for more information.
