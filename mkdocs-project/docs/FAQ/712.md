Consistent with Colorado Water Law, a water rights analysis tracks diversions and associated consumptive 
use based on water rights seniority.  A water rights analysis considers the administration date of ditch 
diversions (i.e. water right priority) in determining whether water used to meet consumptive use demands 
is senior or junior to priorities provided by the user.  This option is most often used when determining 
the consumptive use of only a portion of the water rights under a diversion structure. 

A water rights analysis requires a direct diversion rights file (\*.ddr), that provides water rights 
information for each structure in the analysis.  User-supplied priority(s) to categorize ‘senior’ versus 
‘junior’ consumptive use can be provided as a single priority in the StateCU control file (\*.ccu) or as 
a daily (\*.add) or monthly (\*.adm) time-series of priorities that represent the calling rights on the 
river for the time step specified.  This option is only available under a *Structure Scenario* and can be 
selected from **Menu Control Option** window if structure water rights (\*.ddr) information is provided. 
See [Section 3.4](../Model Description/WaterSupplyStructurePriority.md) for more information.
