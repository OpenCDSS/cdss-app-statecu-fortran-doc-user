Potential consumptive use is the maximum amount of water the crop could use with an unlimited water supply. 
Crop irrigation water requirement is the potential consumptive use minus effective precipitation. Potential 
consumptive use and irrigation water requirement can be determined with either a *Climate Station Scenario* 
or *Structure Scenario*.  In the case of a monthly consumptive use method, only monthly effective precipitation 
methods are available and only if monthly precipitation data are provided, as described in [Section 3.1.3](../Model Description/CropIrr.md). 
With a daily consumptive use method, monthly and/or daily effective precipitation methods are available if 
monthly and/or daily total precipitation data are provided, as described in [Section 3.1.6](../Model Description/CropIrr.md).
