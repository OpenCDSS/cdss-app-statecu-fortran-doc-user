A *Climate Station Scenario* provides consumptive use estimates at a climate station location while a 
*Structure Scenario* provides estimates at a structure (e.g. ditch headgate) location.  A *Climate Station 
Scenario* is less detailed than a *Structure Scenario* and allows for a simplified set of input screens to 
be displayed by the StateCU GUI.  A *Climate Station Scenario* is based on a unit acreage while a *Structure 
Scenario* is based on a user-specified acreage.

The only analyses available with a *Climate Station Scenario* are the unit potential crop consumptive use and 
irrigation water requirement as described in [Section 3.1](../Model Description/CropIrr.md) above.  A *Structure Scenario* also allows a water 
supply limited crop consumptive use and other more complex levels of analyses, as described in [Sections 3.2](../Model Description/WaterSupplyStructure.md)
through [Section 3.5](../Model Description/StateCU.md) above.
