As noted above, there are CDSS basin-wide StateCU scenarios available that include hundreds of structures 
in Division 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.  In addition, there are statewide climate station scenarios that include 
both filled and unfilled climate station data. If the structure or climate station of interest is not 
included in an existing scenario, the user can create a custom scenario by accessing HydroBase data through 
the StateCU HydroBase Wizard.  The wizard launched by using selecting the **Create new StateCU scenario with 
HydroBase Wizard** option under the **File** menu (see [Section 2.4](../GUI/hydrobasewizard.md) above).  If the user wishes to create a more 
complicated scenario that includes many structures or wants to fill missing input data using more detailed 
techniques than filling with averages, the user can develop a dataset using the Stateâ€™s DMI Utilities, TSTool 
and StateDMI, to access the CDSS database, HydroBase, as described in [Section 8](../Supporting Utilities/81.md) below.
