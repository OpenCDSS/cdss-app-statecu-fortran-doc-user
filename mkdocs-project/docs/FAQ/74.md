The information needed to document a particular model scenario depends on the type of analysis (e.g. 
irrigation water requirement versus water supply limited analysis) and the number of climate stations 
and/or structures included in the scenario (e.g. farm level analysis versus entire basin).  A file containing 
a summary of model input data and information (*.sum) is created for each scenario.  Important information 
related to the StateCU model version, scenario name, and data and time of the model run is included at the 
top of the *.sum file.  Additional information needed to document a particular scenario may include, but is 
not limited to: 

* consumptive use method and any adjustment (e.g. elevation adjustment), 
* crop coefficients, 
* climate station assignments and any adjustments (e.g. weighting, orographic adjustment), 
* acreage (annual data),  
* crop distribution (monthly data), 
* diversion data (monthly data). 

This information can be obtained by printing directly from the perspective StateCU GUI input screen, 
copying and pasting information from the GUI into a report, or saving files from GUI and including as 
attachments with a report.
