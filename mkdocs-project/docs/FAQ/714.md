An elevation adjustment can be applied with the Modified or Original Blaney-Criddle method to estimate 
potential consumptive use for any crop type (see [Section 3.1.1.2](../Model Description/CropIrr.md)). The elevation adjustment corrects 
for lower mean temperatures that occur at higher elevations.  An elevation adjustment is automatically 
applied with the Pochop method for bluegrass (see [Section 3.1.1.3](../Model Description/CropIrr.md)). With StateCU, the elevation adjustment 
is applied to the potential consumptive use of a particular crop type. The elevation adjustment can be 
selected through the GUI under the View/Edit Crop Coefficients window (see [Section 2.5.5.1](../GUI/editmenu.md)). 

An orographic adjustment can be applied with monthly or daily method to estimate potential consumptive use 
for any crop type (see [Section 3.1.7](../Model Description/CropIrr.md)). This adjustment is only available under a Structure Scenario. The 
orographic adjustment corrects for climate station data (temperature and precipitation) that is at a different 
location than the irrigated lands. With StateCU, the orographic adjustment is applied to a particular CU 
location (e.g. structure). The orographic adjustment can be specified through the GUI under the Climate 
Station Assignments window (see [Section 2.5.4.1](../GUI/editmenu.md)).
