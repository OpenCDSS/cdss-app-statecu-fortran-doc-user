From the main StateCU GUI splash screen, the **Open existing StateCU scenario** command under the **File** menu allows 
the selection of a response (\*.rcu) file, which results in a scenario being read into the GUI.  As described 
in [Section 2.3.1](../GUI/filemenu.md) above, several base datasets are provided with the StateCU GUI.  The user can create a custom 
scenario for a single structure or climate station using the StateCU HydroBase Wizard, as described in [Section 
2.4](../GUI/hydrobasewizard.md). The user can also develop a dataset using the Stateâ€™s DMI Utilities, TSTool and StateDMI, to access the 
CDSS database, HydroBase, as described in [Section 8](../Supporting Utilities/81.md) below.
