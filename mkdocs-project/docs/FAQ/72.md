A scenario is a dataset that includes all of the input files used to prepare a model simulation (i.e. 
consumptive use analysis).  The input files are specified in the StateCU response (\*.rcu) file. The StateCU 
GUI recognizes two different types of scenarios â€“ a *Climate Station Scenario* and a *Structure Scenario*.

The word scenario may be used interchangeably throughout this document with the words dataset, analysis, 
or simulation.
