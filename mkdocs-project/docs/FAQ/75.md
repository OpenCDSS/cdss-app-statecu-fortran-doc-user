There are CDSS basin-wide StateCU scenarios available that include hundreds of structures in Division 1, 3, 
4, 5, 6, and 7.  In addition, there are statewide climate station scenarios that include both filled and 
unfilled climate station data. If the structure of interest is included in one of the CDSS scenarios, the 
user may want to create a subset scenario that includes their structure(s) or climate station(s) of interest. 
After a scenario is opened, the user can create a subset of the scenario using the **Create new StateCU ‘subset’ 
scenario from existing scenario** option under the **File** menu (see [Section 2.3.5](../GUI/23.md) above) of the StateCU GUI. 
Input data used in the original scenario can be modified and updated through the **Edit** menu.
