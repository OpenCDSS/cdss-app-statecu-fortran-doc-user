A water supply limited consumptive use analysis considers historical water supply available to meet 
irrigated water requirements.  Water supply limited consumptive use is often called actual consumptive 
use, as it is the estimate of the amount of irrigation water actually use by the crops, as contrast to 
potential ET or irrigation water requirements which represent the amount of water the crops need (or 
could use under an unlimited water supply).  This option is only available under a *Structure Scenario* 
and can be selected from **Menu Control Option** window if historical surface water supply data (\*.ddh) 
and irrigation efficiencies (\*.ipy) are provided.  A soil moisture balance can be included in the supply 
limited analysis.  A supply limited analysis is only performed on a monthly time step.  If a daily 
consumptive use method is used, the daily irrigation water requirements are summed to monthly and then 
used in the water supply limited estimate. See [Section 3.2](../ModelDescription/32.md) for more information.
