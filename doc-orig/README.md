# doc-orig

This folder contains the original Word version of the StateCU documentation provided
by Kara Sobieski of WWG on 2018-12-04 with the following comment:

	Please see attached for my latest version of the documentation - GUI Version 7.1,
	StateCU Code Version 13.10 from July 2012.
	This documentation is more recent than that currently available on the CDSS website,
	however it does corresponds to the StateCU Code (StateCU2012.zip) deliverable I provided in February of 2016.

Based on the above, this documentation will be used as the starting point for further modifications.

The Word version is saved as PDF and made available via the `docs/legacy` folder in the Mkdocs project
so that it can be linked to the MkDocs wrapper.
